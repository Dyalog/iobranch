Conversion tools for migration to ⎕IO-sensitive branching in Dyalog v16.0

Many users of APL rightly consider branching using the → symbol to be a deprecated language feature. However, we have decided to make what will probably be a final improvement to branching in version 16.0, by making this function sensitive to index origin (⎕IO) - because braching is similar to indexing, in that you select the next line of code to be executed from a list of lines collected into a function.

No, not really...

Happy April Fools' Day!
